# RL-and-AI-in-Revenue-Management

This repository presents the code applied for my master thesis on "Reinforcement Learning and ArtiÔ¨Åcial Intelligence in the context of revenue management". The capacity control model under customer choice is considered and various are implemented to solve it. Amongst these are
* exact solution (Bellman-equation)
* choice based linear programming
* approximate policy iteration
* linear regression
* neural networks
